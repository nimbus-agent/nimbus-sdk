/**
 * Build a discriminated-union runtime type guard for an agent brief.
 *
 * Every brief guard shares the same base shape check — `kind` matches,
 * `agentVersion === 1`, `gaps` is an array, and `generatedAt`/`latencyMs` are
 * numbers — plus a connector-supplied `extra` predicate for the brief-specific
 * fields. Some guards additionally require a non-null `query` object; this is
 * opt-in via `requireQuery`. The eight concrete guards this package exports
 * (`./brief-guards.ts`) all pass `requireQuery: true`, matching the gateway —
 * which emits the briefs and so defines the wire. The CLI once kept laxer
 * expert/impact/catchup guards that omitted the check; it now consumes the
 * strict SDK guards, so that divergence is gone.
 *
 * The factory exists to remove the byte-mechanical duplication of these guards
 * across the gateway, the CLI, and `@nimbus-dev/client`, all of which now
 * consume the concrete guards from this package rather than defining their own.
